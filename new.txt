Hello guys now i will show you how to link our folder to github

I am linking my folder to github

if you don't have a repository you can initialize repository
else you can publish directly

since I don't have a repository i am initializing one


once we have initialized we have a file in m y folder new.txt we need to push that file into the repository

and the repository  name is your folder name

we need to click publish branch
then select private or public  i am keeping it public

Now lets check if a repositoryhas been created or not in our github(my folder name is FORVSCODE)


but we got a problem here the repo is created on my name
but commit messages are coming on another account name

for that we need to config our git list via terminal


now any commits I do will happen under my acc name
