Hello guys now i will show you how to link our folder to github

I am linking my folder to github

if you don't have a repository you can initialize repository
else you can publish directly

since I don't have a repository i am initializing one


once we have initialized we have a file in m y folder new.txt we need to push that file into the repository

and the repository  name is your folder name
